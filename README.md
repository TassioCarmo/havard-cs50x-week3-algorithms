# Introduction to algorithms
## What did i learn?

### Search

See an array as a bunch of close lockets, because the computer can't see what it's in the with going inside

## algorithms quality

Better designed doesn't use up too much memory, and it isn't redundant

## Running time

### BIg O

“on the order of” something,  higher bound or in other words worst case scenario for the algorithms in relation to steps

common running times
-O(n^2)
-O(n \log n)
-O(n)
-O(\log n)
-O(1)

### Ω Omega

lower bound/best case scenario

Ω(n^2)
-Ω(n \log n)
-Ω(n)
-Ω(\log n)
-Ω(1)

### Θ Theta 

when both big O and Omega are the same

-Θ(n^2)
-Θ(n \log n)
-Θ(n)
-Θ(\log n)
-Θ(1)
